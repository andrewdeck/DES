DES is an _outdated_ and __weak__ encryption algorithm that has been replaced by AES.\r\nDES is a symetric key algorithm, so both the parties need to have the same key to share information.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n* To learn Ruby\r\n* To learn about DES in depth\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n* Generate a key\r\n    `./des.rb --keygen`\r\n* Encrypt a file\r\n    `./des.rb --encrypt <filename> -key <filename>`\r\n* Decrypt a file\r\n    `./des.rb --decrypt <filename> -key <filename>`\r\n\r\n## Who?\r\n\r\nWritten by Andrew Deck.
